## There’s nothing new under the sun
I recently came across this letter in a collection.  It clearly shows that the email from your friend” who is in “trouble” is one of the oldest scams in the book.

## A swindle by telephone
16 January 1926
Sir
I wish to warn your readers about a swindle which has trapped even astute men of business. The modus operandi is a telephone call from a person claiming to be a friend or to have a business or personal connection with the victim.  The gentleman is in destress, having been robbed of his purse. 
Would his friend help him with a telegraph remittance in the nearest post office to enable him to return to his home in the counties? This in itself sounds bald and unconvincing, but is elaborated with sufficient circumstantial detail to make the sorry appear genuine.  The device comes from America, where it appears to be very successfully played, and is a very profitable transaction for the swindler, who will continue to make a handsome revenue if the public is not warned. 
The most effective answer is to promise the required help and then, immediately, to communicate with the police, who, if the case is genius, can render the assistance needed, or, if not, can put a stop to these activities.  No doubt the trick will appear in varying disguises, so as to keep it fresh, but the net result will be the same.

Yours truly, 

Vigilans
